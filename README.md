# TSP-SOLVER

This algorithm uses the basic ideas of evolution to create an optimal solution for any traveling salesman problem. Currently it takes two inputs: the population size, and the number of generations you want to run,
The greater the population size the better then results you will get. This is also true for the number of generations run, however it is no nearly as important as the population size. The algorithm still needs a lot of work. First of all it very slow when working with large population sizes, however the algorithm only produces good solutions when working with a large population. 
Also because of the inherit randomness of the algorithm, you are almost guaranteed to not to get the same answer twice. I would like to modify it in the future to make it more consistent.
